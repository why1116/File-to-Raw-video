# File-to-Raw-video
Converts (almost any file) into raw video.
------------------------------------------
# Intructions
Make sure Python is installed, if not you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Extract the .zip file, run the exe then you should be able to select the destination, then after a bit the video should generate and you have yourself a yummy crisp video.
